This branch is for creating a Debt Avalance calculator/tracker.
Users will be able to enter in each cretitor they owe, the balance owed, how much interest they owe, and the monthly minimum payment owed.
This tracker will figure up the total monthly minimums as a payoff budget, then ask how much more money the user can add to the monthly payoff budget.
This tracker will then calculate which debt to pay off 1st based on paying off the one with the highest interest rate 1st, in accordance with the Debt Avalanche principal.
Then, using the Debt Avalance principal, will show what to pay each month on each debt, and as one debt falls off, the budget stays the same until all are paid.
The tracker will show how long it will take to pay off all the debts and show how much money was saved in interest.
