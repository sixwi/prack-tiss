Question: 
How can I store value in variables from user input forms using JavaScript?

Answer:
 In order to obtain the values users are putting into forms you’re going 
to need to utilize event listeners and callback functions.

<body>

<input type="text" id="userName" /> 
<input type="button" onclick="myFunction()" value="Name?">
<p id="demo"></p>

<!-- 
We create a variable, “theirInput”, that will hold the user’s input.
We add an event listener to “inputElement” that triggers on “change” 
and will fire an anonymous function when “change” is emitted.
The anonymous function sets “theirInput” to be equal to the event’s 
target’s value - which just so happens to be the text that was input by a 
user in the text field when they are no longer focused on the element

<script> 
  var inputElement = document.getElementById('userName'); 
  var theirInput = ''; 
  inputElement.addEventListener('change', function(e) { 
  theirInput = e.target.value; 
  });  
  function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = 'Welcome, ' + theirInput + "!"
  }
</script>

<!-- 
This code makes a lot of assumptions and is not made for production use 
but rather solely as an example. Realistically, you’d likely want to 
operate on the value of the text field within the anonymous callback 
function rather than storing it globally.
